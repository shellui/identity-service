"""Container health check (Dockerfile HEALTHCHECK): GET /health/live on the local gunicorn.

Web mode: gunicorn always binds 0.0.0.0:8000 (tools/docker-entrypoint.sh), so the port is
fixed on purpose; a PORT env set by a platform does not move gunicorn. /health/live answers
in LivenessMiddleware, before SecurityMiddleware, sessions and the database, so it needs no
auth, does no DB or Redis work and is never redirected to https. The Host and
X-Forwarded-Proto headers keep it passing even if that middleware order changes.

Worker mode (entrypoint `worker`): PID 1 is the Celery process. There is no HTTP server, and
Docker already restarts the container when that process exits, so the check passes.

Output never includes env values; only the error class is printed.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-27

### ✨ Feature

- RS256 JWT signing with a public JWKS endpoint so other services can verify tokens without sharing secrets.
- Optional Sentry error reporting via `SENTRY_DSN` (Django exceptions and `ERROR`-level logs).

### 🚨 Changed

- OAuth credentials are configured per company; global GitHub, Google, and Microsoft environment variables are removed.
- JWT access and refresh token lifetimes are configurable via `JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFETIME` and `JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFETIME` (defaults `5m` and `7d`).
- Token refresh (`POST /api/v1/token`) accepts a valid `refresh_token` without requiring a Bearer access token.

### 📚 Documentation

- Added [docs/jwks.md](docs/jwks.md) and updated setup guides for JWT keys and OAuth configuration.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-23

### ✨ Feature

- Initial release of `identity-service`.

- Added **configuration** for **local development** and **environment variables**.
- Added project setup for future **authentication** and **user management** workflows.
- Added OAuth login support for GitHub, Google, and Microsoft providers.
- Added JWT session lifecycle endpoints (`/api/v1/token`, `/api/v1/logout`) and authenticated user profile APIs.
- Added staff directory endpoints for users and groups administration workflows.

### 🛠 Improvements

- Added OpenAPI documentation with drf-spectacular integration and improved API tagging.
- Expanded local container workflow with migration-on-start entrypoint.

### 🚨 Changed

- Updated Docker runtime to persist SQLite data at `/app/data/db.sqlite3`.

### 📚 Documentation

- Added clearer Docker run examples using a named volume (`identity-service-data`) for persistent data.
